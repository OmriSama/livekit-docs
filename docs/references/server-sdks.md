title: Server SDKs
---

We officially support client wrappers for the following platforms. Since the service is HTTP-based, you are welcome to call it directly without using the client wrappers. In addition to Room APIs, the server SDKs also enables you to generate access tokens.

| Platform | Repo                                                        | Links                                                                                                            |
