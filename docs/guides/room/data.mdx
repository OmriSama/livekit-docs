Working with Custom Data
Mainly talk about how LiveKit could allow users to send/receive arbitrary data.
1. per participant metadata, can be updated by server API, broadcasted to all participants. could encode anything application specific
2. arbitrary data messages, use LocalParticipant.publishData, have reliable vs lossy options, etc
