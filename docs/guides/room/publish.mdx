One or more audio/video tracks can be added to the room at any point during the session. LiveKit has the concept of `TrackPublication` and `Track`. A `TrackPublication` can be thought of as a collection of track metadata registered with the server.

Once a Track is registered with the server, a Publication is created and all participants in the room are notified of it. They may not be subscribed to the Track, but are aware of the presence of it.

Moreover, `TrackPublication` object offers a way to interact with the track, exposing functionalities such as mute, etc.
