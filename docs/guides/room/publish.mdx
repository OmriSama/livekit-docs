One or more audio/video tracks can be added to a room at any point during the session. LiveKit models tracks with two constructs: `TrackPublication` and `Track`. Think of a `TrackPublication` as metadata for a track registered with the server. Every participant can access all track publications in a room, even if they aren't subscribed to them. You may also mute a track via `TrackPublication`.

Once subscribed, the `Track` object allows you to play its associated media or add the information it contains to your application's interface.

  For convenience, LiveKit provides a few [preset resolutions](https://docs.livekit.io/client-sdk-ios/VideoPreset/) when creating a video track. You also have control over the encoding bitrate with [publishing options](https://docs.livekit.io/client-sdk-ios/LocalVideoTrackPublishOptions/).

  When creating audio tracks, you have control over the [capture settings](https://docs.livekit.io/client-sdk-ios/LocalAudioTrackOptions/).

## Audio on mobile

When using audio on iOS or Android, it's important to consider the device's audio stack, in order to behave well with other apps.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ios"
  groupId="client-sdk"
  values={[
    {label: 'iOS', value: 'ios'},
    {label: 'Android', value: 'android'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="ios">

On iOS, LiveKit provides automatic management of `AVAudioSession`. It acquires the session when you join a room, and releases it after you disconnect from the room. It may be desirable to override the default settings. To do so, call [LiveKit.configureAudioSession](https://docs.livekit.io/client-sdk-ios/LiveKit/#livekit.configureaudiosession(category:mode:policy:options:)) before connecting to a room.

```swift
LiveKit.configureAudioSession(category: .playAndRecord, mode: .videoChat)
LiveKit.connect(...)
```

:::note

Some combinations of `Category`, `Mode`, `RouteSharingPolicy`, and `CategoryOptions` are incompatible. `AVFoundation` documentation isn't very good, making it tricky to set the right combination of values for these properties.

On Android, you'll want request audio focus from AudioManager.

```kotlin
val audioManager = getSystemService(AUDIO_SERVICE) as AudioManager
with(audioManager) {
    isSpeakerphoneOn = true
    isMicrophoneMute = false
    mode = AudioManager.MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION
}
val result = audioManager.requestAudioFocus(
    focusChangeListener,
    AudioManager.STREAM_VOICE_CALL,
    AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN,
)
```

and after you are done, reset

```kotlin
with(audioManager) {
    isSpeakerphoneOn = false
    isMicrophoneMute = true
    abandonAudioFocus(focusChangeListener)
    mode = AudioManager.MODE_NORMAL
}
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Mute and unmute

You can mute any track to stop it from sending data to the server. When a track is muted, LiveKit will trigger a `TrackMuted` event on all participants in the room. You can use this event to update your app's UI and reflect the correct state to all users in the room.

Mute/unmute a track using its corresponding `LocalTrackPublication` object.

## Disabling video

While a muted video track with a camera source won't transmit any data, the camera recording indicator will remain on.

One workaround is to unpublish the video track when a user disables their video. If/when that same user re-enables their video, recreate the video track and republish it.

## Video simulcasting

Currently, simulcasting is only available in browser-based SDKs.

With simulcasting, clients publish multiple versions of the same video track with varying resolutions. This allows LiveKit to dynamically forward the stream that's most appropriate given each participant's available bandwidth.

To enable simulcasting, pass a flag when publishing a video track.

```typescript title="Browser (typescript)"
const videoTrack = await createLocalVideoTrack()
const videoPublication = await room.localParticipant.publishTrack(videoTrack, {
  simulcast: true
})
```
