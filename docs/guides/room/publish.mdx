One or more audio/video tracks can be added to the room at any point during the session. LiveKit represent Tracks with two concepts: `TrackPublication` and `Track`. A `TrackPublication` can be thought of as metadata of the track that's registered with the server. Every participant has a view of all of the TrackPublications in the room, even when they are not subscribed to them. `TrackPublication` also lets you mute the track.

Once subscribed, the Track object allows you to play media, or to be integrated within the UI.

      }
    })

    const videoPublication = await room.localParticipant.publishTrack(videoTrack)
    const audioPublication = await room.localParticipant.publishTrack(audioTrack)
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ios">

  ```swift
  var videoOpts = LocalVideoTrackOptions()
  videoOpts.captureParameter = VideoPreset.hd.capture
  let videoTrack = try LocalVideoTrack.createTrack(name: "video", options: videoOpts)
  let audioTrack = LocalAudioTrack.createTrack(name: "localAudio")
  let videoPublication = localParticipant.publishVideoTrack(track: videoTrack)
  let audioPublication = localParticipant.publishAudioTrack(track: audioTrack)
  ```

  When creating a video track, LiveKit provides a few [preset resolutions](https://docs.livekit.io/client-sdk-ios/VideoPreset/) for convenience. You also have control over the encoding bitrate with [publishing options](https://docs.livekit.io/client-sdk-ios/LocalVideoTrackPublishOptions/)

  When creating audio tracks, you have control over the [capture settings](https://docs.livekit.io/client-sdk-ios/LocalAudioTrackOptions/) as well.

## Audio on mobile

When using audio on iOS and Android, it's important to take note of the audio stack in order to play well with other apps.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ios"
  groupId="client-sdk"
  values={[
    {label: 'iOS', value: 'ios'},
    {label: 'Android', value: 'android'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="ios">

On iOS, LiveKit provides automatic management of AVAudioSession. It acquires the session when you join a room, and releases it after you disconnect from the room. It may be desirable to override the default settings. To do so you would call [LiveKit.configureAudioSession](https://docs.livekit.io/client-sdk-ios/LiveKit/#livekit.configureaudiosession(category:mode:policy:options:)) prior to connecting to a room.

```swift
LiveKit.configureAudioSession(category: .playAndRecord, mode: .videoChat)
LiveKit.connect(...)
```

:::note

Not all of the Category, Mode, RouteSharingPolicy, and CategoryOptions are compatible with each other. It's quite tricky to find the right combinations as AVFoundation docs aren't great on this topic.

On Android, you'll want request audio focus from AudioManager.

```kotlin
val audioManager = getSystemService(AUDIO_SERVICE) as AudioManager
with(audioManager) {
    isSpeakerphoneOn = true
    isMicrophoneMute = false
    mode = AudioManager.MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION
}
val result = audioManager.requestAudioFocus(
    focusChangeListener,
    AudioManager.STREAM_VOICE_CALL,
    AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN,
)
```

and after you are done, reset

```kotlin
with(audioManager) {
    isSpeakerphoneOn = false
    isMicrophoneMute = true
    abandonAudioFocus(focusChangeListener)
    mode = AudioManager.MODE_NORMAL
}
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Mute & Unmute

For each track, it's possible to mute it so that it stops sending data to the server. When you mute a track, LiveKit will also trigger a `TrackMuted` event for all of the participants in the room, enabling your app's UI to display the appropriate update to the user.

You can mute/unmute a track on its `LocalTrackPublication`

## Disabling video

With video tracks from the camera, muting them does not turn off the recording indicator on the camera, even though no data is being transmitted from the camera.

To work around this limitation, you could unpublish the video track when a user disables their video. When a user re-enables video, you could recreate the video track and republish it.

## Video Simulcasting

Currently only available in the browser client.

Simulcasting lets the client publish multiple versions of the same video track with varying resolutions. This allows LiveKit to dynamically forward the stream that's most appropriate for each participant's available bandwidth.

To enable simulcasting, pass a flag when publishing the track.

```typescript title="Browser (typescript)"
const videoTrack = await createLocalVideoTrack()
const videoPublication = await room.localParticipant.publishTrack(videoTrack, {
  simulcast: true
})
```
