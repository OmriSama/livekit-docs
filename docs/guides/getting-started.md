This guide will get you running with a LiveKit server with an app connecting to it as a participant.

## Overview

LiveKit is a WebRTC SFU at its core. This means it'll act as a WebRTC peer and maintain connections with each participant in the room. All of the client participants connect to LiveKit server, and not with each other.

LiveKit has built-in authentication with JWT tokens generated by provided server-side SDKs. The ideal integration pattern is for your app's backend to create a JWT-based access token using an API key / symmetrical secret pair. LiveKit client SDKs will connect to the server with the generated token.

## Setting up the server

###

The simplest way to run LiveKit is to run it in single-node mode on your machine:

```shell
docker run --rm -e LIVEKIT_KEYS="<key>: <secret>" livekit/livekit-server:v0.9
```
