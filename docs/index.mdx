LiveKit is an open source project that provides scalable, multi-user conferencing over WebRTC. It's designed to give you everything you need to build real time video/audio capabilities in your applications.

## Features

- Horizontally scalable WebRTC Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)
- Modern, full-featured [client SDKs](references/client-sdks.md) for JS, iOS, Android
- Built for production - JWT authentication and [server APIs](references/server-apis.md)
- Robust networking & connectivity, over UDP & TCP
- Easy to deploy, a single binary and only three ports to forward.
- Advanced features - simulcasting, selective subscription, moderation APIs.

## Why LiveKit?

WebRTC is a powerful protocol that now has ubiquitous support across all major browsers and mobile platforms. However, building apps with it isn't simple; it requires an understanding of core protocol concepts and the user is responsible for complexities like signaling and coordinating connections between peers. As a peer to peer protocol, scaling WebRTC to a large number of peers also becomes challenging.

While there are hosted solutions available like Twilio and Agora. They can be cost prohibitive and being proprietary products, create vendor lock-in. Other open source solutions also exist, but they come with a steep learning curve, and can be daunting to customize and deploy.

We built LiveKit because we believe there should be a free, open source implementation of WebRTC rooms that "just works" for app developers. LiveKit provides an opinionated, end-to-end implementation of multi-user conferencing with first-party clients for all major platforms.

## Architecture

LiveKit is written in Go. It's made possible because of [Pion](https://github.com/pion/webrtc), [ion-sfu](https://github.com/pion/ion-sfu), and the amazing community behind them.

LiveKit is horizontally scalable: you can run it on one node or 100, with identical configuration. They use peer to peer routing via Redis to ensure clients in the same room are connected to the same node.

When deployed, its only external dependency is Redis.
